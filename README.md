# React e-commerce mockup with Existential Comics T-shirts

Checck out the live preview <a href="https://dreamy-saha-641e2a.netlify.app/"> here </a>

In this project I used
<ul>
<li>React Router</li>
<li>React Bootstrap</li>
<li>React Context API</li>
</ul>

There are a bunch of different pages that are linked. The user can add as many items as s/he wishes. But cannot buy any, as I do not own any of these products.
